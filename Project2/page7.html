        <p>Based on your choices, this may have altered your fate.
            If you chose the path of strength, you have defeated Malakar
            and will be remembered for milleniums to come! If you chose the path of wisdom, you outsmarted
            Malakar, but at the cost of your own life ultimately sacraficing yourself in the end.
            If you chose the path of stealth, Malakar was no fool to you sneaking around and 
            easily defeated you, ultimately embarrassing you in the end.</p>
            <p>The kingdom will remember your deeds for generations to come.</p>
        <p>We hope you enjoyed your adventure. Would you like to provide feedback on your experience?</p>

        <p>I would like to thank my parents for being supportive throughout my life.
            Specifically for this portion of my life, I want to thank my father for giving me his
            best effort in trying to set me up for success in the future.
